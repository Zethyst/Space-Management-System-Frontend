## 🚀 Getting Started:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:


- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1 or later)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (v12 or later)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (v6 or later)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or any compatible database)

## 🏠 Running the Project Locally:

Follow these steps to run the Angular and .NET project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Zethyst/Space-Management-System.git
    cd Space-Management-System
    ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Angular Development Server:**

    Start the Angular development server:

    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the Angular application running!

4. **Set Up the Backend:**

    Navigate to the `backend` folder:

    ```sh
    cd ../backend
    ```

    Restore .NET dependencies:

    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

5. **Run the .NET Backend:**

    Start the .NET backend server:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or another port as configured).

6. **Configure the Database:**

    Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your SQL Server instance. Run migrations to set up the database:

    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

7. **Connect Frontend and Backend:**

    Ensure the Angular app is configured to communicate with the .NET backend by updating the API base URL in the `environment.ts` file.
